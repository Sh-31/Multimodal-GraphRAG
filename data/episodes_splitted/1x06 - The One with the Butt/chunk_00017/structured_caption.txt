Chunk: chunk_00017
Subtitles: You. - You have me. - No, no. Just you. What do you mean? Lose the other guys. Like, all of them? Come on, we're great together. Why not? Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, laugh and make love... ...without feeling obligated to one another? Up until tonight, I thought that's what you wanted too. Well, part of me wants that... ...but it's like I'm two guys. I mean, one guy's saying, "Shut up! This is great!" But there's this other guy. It's the guy who wells up every time the Grinch's heart... ...grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device. He's saying, you know, "This is too hard. Get out, get out!" So which one of the two guys will you listen to? I have to listen to both. They don't let each other finish. Which one?
