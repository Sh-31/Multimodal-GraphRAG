Chunk: chunk_00015
Subtitles: Everybody, I would like to get this in one take. Let's roll it. Water's working. And action! And cut! Butt guy, what are you doing? I'm showering. No, that was clenching. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, you know? His wife's dead, his brother's missing. I think his butt would be angry here. I think his butt would like to get the shot before lunch. Once again, rolling. Water working. And action! And cut! What was that? I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask... God, I love these fingers. Thank you. No, actually, I meant my fingers.
