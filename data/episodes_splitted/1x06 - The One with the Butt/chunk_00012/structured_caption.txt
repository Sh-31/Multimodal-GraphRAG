I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then... ...I'm his butt. Oh, my God! Come on, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it and that's big! Oh, no, it's terrific. After all your years of struggling... ...you've finally been able to crack your way into show business. Okay, fine. Make jokes, I don't care. This is a big break for me!
