Subtitles: Aren't you the guy who plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie? Nope. No? What happened, big guy? Big guy? It felt like a "big guy" moment. I got fired! They said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this. Everybody will be expecting to see me. You know what? No one will be able to tell. My mom will. There's something so sweet... ...and disturbing about that. I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years... ...and I finally get my shot, and I blow it! Maybe this wasn't your shot.
