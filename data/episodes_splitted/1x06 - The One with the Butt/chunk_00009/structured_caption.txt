Subtitles: I don't know what it's for. Nobody knows, and we're not supposed to ask. RACHEL: What do you think? CHANDLER: It's very clean. MONICA: Really, it looks great! Oh. Heh. I see you moved the green ottoman. ROSS & PHOEBE: Uh-oh. How did that happen? I don't know. I thought it looked better there. And also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table. Yeah, it's interesting. But you know what? Just for fun... ...let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Just to compare. Let's see. Ha! Well, it looks good there too. Let's leave it there for a while. I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman. Thank God you didn't fan out the magazines. She'll scratch your eyes out. You guys, I am not that bad! Yeah, you are.
