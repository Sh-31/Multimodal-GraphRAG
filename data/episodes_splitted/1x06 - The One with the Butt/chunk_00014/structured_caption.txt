Subtitles: No, no, no. No resentment. Believe me... ...it's worth it, okay? In a relationship, you have these key moments... ...you'll remember for the rest of your life. Well, every single second is like that with Aurora. And I've just wasted 35 of them talking to you. So, uh, Monica, can you help me with the door? Um, Chandler, you know, the old Monica would remind you... ...to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush. But I'm not gonna do that. DIRECTOR: Damn it! Hire the girl. Okay, everybody ready? Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity. Lose the robe. Me? That would work. Right. Okay. Losing the robe! Okay, and the robe is lost. Everybody, I would like to get this in one take.
