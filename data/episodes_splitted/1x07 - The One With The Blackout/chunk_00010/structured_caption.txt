Subtitles: ...and now you're in the "Friend Zone." No, no, no. I'm not in the Zone. No, Ross. You're mayor of the Zone. Look, I'm taking my time, all right? I'm laying the groundwork. Every day I get a little bit closer to, uh... Priesthood. Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon, you'll end up stuck in the Zone forever. I will, I will. I'm waiting for the, uh, right moment. What? - What, now? - Yeah. What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? Huh? You gotta go up to her and say, "Look, Rachel, I think..." - Shh! - Shh! - What are we shushing? - We're shushing... ...because we're trying to hear something. - What? - Uh, don't you hear that?
