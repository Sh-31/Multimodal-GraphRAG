Subtitles: I've never had a relationship with that kind of passion. Where you have to have somebody right there in the middle of a theme park. It was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line. Well, Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature-golf course. - Come on. - No. He said we were holding up the people behind us. And you didn't marry him because? Do you think there are people that go through life... ...never having that kind of? - Probably. - Really? I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated. - Yeah, right. - It is. Eventually, it kind of burns out. But hopefully what you're left with is trust and security and, uh... In my ex-wife's case, lesbianism. For all those people who miss out on that, uh, passion thing...
