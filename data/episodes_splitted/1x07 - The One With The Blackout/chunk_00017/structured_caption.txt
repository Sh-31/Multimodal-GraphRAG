Subtitles: The cat turned out to be Paolo's cat. Isn't that funny? That is funny. And Rachel keeps touching him. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere. Oh, I found him. It was Paolo's cat. Ah. Well, there you go. Last to know again. And I'm guessing, since nobody told me, this is Paolo? Oh. Paolo, this is Phoebe. [SPEAKS IN ITALIAN] You betcha. CHANDLER [THINKING]: All right. Okay. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a, uh, boyish charm. It's impish. Here we go.
