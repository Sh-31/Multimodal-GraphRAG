Episode: 1x03 - The One With The Thumb
Chunk: chunk_00004
Subtitles: I think this is probably why Dimon smokes in his cell alone. - What? - Relax your hand. Let your wrist go. - Not so much. - Whoa. Hey. All right. Now try taking a puff. Right. - Okay, no, give it to me. - No, no, no. I'm not giving you a cigarette. No, it's fine. It's fine. Look, do you want to get this part or not? Here. All right. Now, don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. - You feel complete. - You miss it? No, not so much. All right. Now we smoke. Oh, my God. No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb...
