Episode: 1x03 - The One With The Thumb
Chunk: chunk_00015
Subtitles: Huh. A thumb? GROUP: Ew. I know, I know. I opened it up and there it was... ...just floating in there, like this tiny little hitchhiker. Maybe it's a contest, you know? Like "Collect all five." Does, um, anyone wanna see? No, thanks. - Oh, hey, don't do that. Come on. - Cut that out. It's worse than the thumb. Hey, this is so unfair. - Why is it unfair? - So I have a flaw. Big deal. Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word. And Monica, with that snort when she laughs. I mean, what the hell is that thing? I accept all those flaws. Why can't you accept me for this? Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody, or just him?
