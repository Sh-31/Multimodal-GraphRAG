Subtitles: Why should I let them meet him? I bring a guy home and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd. Listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef... ...I'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing. Come on, they're your friends. They're looking out after you. I know, I know. I wish that once I'd bring a guy home they actually liked. Well, you do realize that the odds of that happening are a little slimmer... ...if they never get to meet the guy. Let it go, Ross. Yeah? Well, you didn't know Chi-Chi. MONICA: Do you all promise? - Yeah, we promise. We'll be good. JOEY: We promise. Chandler, do you promise to be good?
