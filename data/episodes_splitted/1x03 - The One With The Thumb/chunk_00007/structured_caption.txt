It's going pretty good, you know? It's nice and we're having fun. - So when do we get to meet the guy? ROSS: Yeah. Let's see, today's Monday... - Never. - Come on. - No, not after what happened with Steve. - What are you talking about? [LISPING] We love Steve. Steve was sexy. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Sorry.
