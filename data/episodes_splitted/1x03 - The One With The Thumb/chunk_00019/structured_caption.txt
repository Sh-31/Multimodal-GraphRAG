Subtitles: CHANDLER: Oh, Lamb Chop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for 30 years, it'd be talking too. Okay, I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. Hey. Where's Joey? Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong? - I think he's across the hall. - Thanks. There you go. Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. Hey, Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop Tart? Does anyone want the rest of this Pop Tart? Hey, I might. I'm sorry. You know, those stupid soda people gave me $7000 for the thumb. - Oh, my God. - Seven thousand dollars? And on my way over here, I stepped in gum.
