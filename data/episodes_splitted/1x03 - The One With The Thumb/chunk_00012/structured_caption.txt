Subtitles: Well... - We won! - We won! Thank you! Yeah. Fantastic. I have one question: How is that possible? - Alan. - He was unbelievable. He was like that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions. But instead of Bugs, it was first base, Alan. Second base, Alan... I mean, it was like he made us into a team. Yep. We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers... ...a thing or two about softball. - Nice. Can I ask you guys a question? Do you ever think that Alan is maybe sometimes... - What? - I don't know. A little too Alan? Oh, no. That's not possible. You can never be too Alan. Yeah, it's his innate Alan-ness that we adore. - I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan. - Oh! - Hey, Lizzy. - Hey, Weird Girl.
