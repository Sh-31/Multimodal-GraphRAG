Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping. Okay. Okay. Let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear with every step I took? "Not mine. Not mine. Not mine." And even if I was happy, okay, and skipping... ...I'd hear, "Not mine. Not mine." We're with you. We got it. Okay, I'd never be able to enjoy it. It'd be like this giant karmic debt. Chandler, what are you doing? Hey. What are you doing? Oh, gross. - What is this? - I'm smoking. I'm smoking. I'm smoking. I can't believe you. You've been so good for three years.
