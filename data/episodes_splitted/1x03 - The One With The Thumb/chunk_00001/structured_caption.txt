Subtitles: - Hi, guys. JOEY: Hey, Phoebe. Hey, oh, how did it go? Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said, "We should do this again." - Ouch. - What? He said, "We should do it again." That's good, right? Uh, no. Loosely translated, "We should do this again," means: "You will never see me naked." Since when? Since always. It's, like, dating language. You know, like, "It's not you," means, "It is you." "You're such a nice guy," means: "I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics... ...and complaining about them to you." Or, you know, um, "I think we should see other people," means: "Ha, ha, I already am." And everybody knows this? Oh, yeah. Cushions the blow. Like when you're a kid and your parents put your dog to sleep... ...and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. That's funny. No, because, uh, our parents actually did... ...uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
