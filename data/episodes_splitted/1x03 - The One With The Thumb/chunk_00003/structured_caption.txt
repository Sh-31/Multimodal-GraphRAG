Subtitles: CHANDLER: "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?" Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die. - Hey, that was really good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Thanks. Let's keep going. Okay. "So, what do you want from me, Dimon? Huh?" I just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell, I can smoke. "Smoke away." Heh. [COUGHING] I think this is probably why Dimon smokes in his cell alone.
