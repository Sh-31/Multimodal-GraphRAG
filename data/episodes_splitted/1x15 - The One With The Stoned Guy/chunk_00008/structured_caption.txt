Subtitles: Okay, try this salmon mousse. - Mm. Good. MONICA: Yeah? Is it better than the other salmon mousse? It's creamier. Yeah? Well, is that better? I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, you know? God, what happened to you? Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests... ...intelligence tests, personality tests, and what do I learn? "You're ideally suited for a career in data processing... ...for a large multi-national corporation." That's so great, because you already know how to do that. Can you believe it? Don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...
