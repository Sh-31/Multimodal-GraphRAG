I'm inputting my numbers... ...and Big Al calls me into his office... ...and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor. - That is great! - Congratulations. So I quit. BOTH: Why? Why? This was supposed to be a temp job. Yeah, Chandler, you've been there for five years. I know, but if I took it this... ...it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do. So was it a lot more money? Doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys... ...that's in his office until 12:00 at night worrying about the WENUS. "The WENUS"? Weekly estimated net usage system. It's a processing term. Oh, that WENUS. So, what are you gonna do? I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know. I'm not gonna figure it out working there. Oh!
