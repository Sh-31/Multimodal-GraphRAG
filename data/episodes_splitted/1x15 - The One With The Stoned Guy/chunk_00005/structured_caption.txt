Subtitles: Can you see my nipples through this shirt? No, but don't worry. I'm sure they're still there. Where you going, Mr. Suit-ey Man? Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pilman... ...career counselor-a-go-go. I added the "a-go-go." Career counselor? Hey, you guys all know what you want to do. I don't. Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream. Ah, the lesser known "I Don't Have a Dream" speech. Oh, I love my life. I love my life. Brian's Song. The meeting with that guy went great? So great. He showed me where the restaurant's gonna be. It's this cute little place on 10th Street. It's not too big, not too small. It's just right. Was it formerly owned by a blond woman and some bears?
