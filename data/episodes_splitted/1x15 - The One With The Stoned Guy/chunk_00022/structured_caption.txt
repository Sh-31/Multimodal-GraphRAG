Chunk: chunk_00022
Subtitles: So, uh, how did it go with Celia? Oh, uh, I was unbelievable. All right, Ross. I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines... ...themes, a motif. At one point, there were villagers. Oh, and, uh... Well, um, you know, by the time we finished with all the dirty talk... ...it was kind of late and we were both exhausted, so... - You cuddled. - Yeah, which was nice. Do you guys want to try to catch a late movie or something? Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler? Whoa. Where the hell is he? Yes, Fran, I know what time it is... ...but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy. Oh, really? Well, let me tell you something. You will care about it because I care about it. Got it? Good!
