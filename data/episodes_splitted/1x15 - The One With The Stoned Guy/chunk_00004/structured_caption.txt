Subtitles: I have this new massage client. Steve. Anyway, um, he's opening up a restaurant... ...and he's looking for a head chef. Um, hi there. Hi. Oh, yeah, I know. You're a chef, I know, and I thought of you first. But, um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so... Yeah, I just don't have a lot of chefing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant. - Yeah. Yeah. - Well, what kind of food is he looking for? He wants to do something eclectic, so he's looking for someone... ...who can, you know, create the entire menu. - Oh, my God. - Yeah, I know. So, what do you think? Thanks, Pheeb. I just don't really see myself in a big white hat. Okay. Oh, Monica. Guess what?
