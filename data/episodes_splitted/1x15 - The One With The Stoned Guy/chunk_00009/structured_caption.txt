Subtitles: You know, I just always pictured myself doing something... Something. Oh, Chandler, I know, I know. Oh, hey, you can see your nipples through this shirt. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Here you go. Maybe this will cheer you up. Ooh, you know, um, I had a grape about five hours ago... ...so I better split this with you. It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amuse-bouche. Well, it is amusing. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Oh, hi, Wendy. Yeah, 8:00. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour? Okay, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye. Ten dollars an hour for what? I asked a waitress at work to help me out. Waitressing? Uh-oh.
