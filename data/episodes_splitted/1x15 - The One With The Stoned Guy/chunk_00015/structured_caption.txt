Subtitles: Hello? Heh. And again. Ah. Hey, Mr. Costilick. How's life on the 15th floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous. Uh, but look, this isn't about the money. You know? I need something that's more than a job. I need something I really care about... And that's on top of the year-end bonus structure you mentioned earlier? BOTH: Your dream. Look, Al. Al, I'm not playing hardball here, okay? This is not a negotiation. This is a rejection. No... No, no. No, no. No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You got the wrong guy! I'll see you Monday! Ah. Huh? Wow. It's huge.
