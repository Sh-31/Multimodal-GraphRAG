Subtitles: Yeah. You know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding... ...I have wondered whether I made the right choice. Oh. And now I know. MONICA: I'm so glad. Big day. All right, I'll give you this: Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean, he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat... Did you know he's gay? I just wanna clarify this. Are you outing Mr. Peanut? - Chandler? - Danielle, hi. Everybody, this is Danielle. Danielle, everybody. GROUP: Hi. - What are you doing here? - I've been calling you... ...but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here and make sure you were okay.
