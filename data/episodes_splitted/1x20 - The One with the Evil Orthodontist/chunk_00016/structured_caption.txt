Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better... ...when Barry and I got engaged, he went through a weird thing too. Oh, God. You see, that's what I was afraid of. - What? What's what you were afraid of? - Okay, okay. When Barry was engaged to you, he and I... ...kind of had a little thing on the side. - What? - I know, I know. When he proposed to me, everyone said, "Don't do it. He's gonna do to you what he did to Rachel." And now I feel so stupid. Ha, ha. Hmm. Oh, Mindy. Oh, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid. What do you mean? - Smell familiar? MINDY: Oh, no.
