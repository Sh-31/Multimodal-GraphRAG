Chunk: chunk_00005
Subtitles: It was comfortable and it was familiar. It was just nice. That's "nice" twice. Rachel, what's going on? Isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar? Duh. Where have you been? Yeah, but it was different with him today. He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, you know? I mean, we had fun. Is there anything wrong with that? Yes. - Why? - I have my reasons. Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman... ...who just happens to be your ex-best friend? All right. All right, all right, all right. I know it's stupid. I'll go see him this afternoon and I will just put an end to it. Wow. - Wow. - Ha, ha. Yeah. I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that. No, it wasn't.
