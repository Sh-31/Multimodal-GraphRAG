Subtitles: Um... Mindy. Mindy, of course, Mindy. It was always Mindy. Even when we were having sex in that chair? I swear, look, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you. Oh, please. During that second time, you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup. You did it twice? Well, the first time didn't really count. You know, it was Barry. Oh, right. Honey, baby, sweetheart, look... Just give me another chance, okay? We'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba. What do you say? BERNICE [OVER INTERCOM]: Dr. Farber, we've got an emergency here. Jason Castalano's choking on his retainer. Oh, God. Uh, I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? - I'll be right back. - Okay. Okay, and we'll be here, hating you. See how he was sweating when he walked out of here? If I'm hogging the ball, you jump right in there... ...and take a couple of punches. Because I'm telling you, this feels great.
