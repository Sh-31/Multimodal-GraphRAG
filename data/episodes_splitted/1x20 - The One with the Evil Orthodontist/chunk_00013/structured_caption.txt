Subtitles: Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy. Relax. She may not even know. Please, I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me. I mean, what else is it about? She was my best friend, you guys. We went to camp together... ...she taught me how to kiss... - Yeah? Now, you know, I'm, like, the other woman. - Ugh, I feel so... - Naughty. - I'll see you guys later. - I'll walk out with you. When she taught you to kiss, you were at camp... ...and were you wearing any kind of little uniform or...? That's fine, yeah. Okay, I'm gonna go the bathroom. Will you watch my phone? - Why don't you just take it with you? - Hey. We haven't been on a second date. She needs to hear me pee? Why don't you just call her? I can't call her. I left a message. I have some pride. - Do you? - No.
