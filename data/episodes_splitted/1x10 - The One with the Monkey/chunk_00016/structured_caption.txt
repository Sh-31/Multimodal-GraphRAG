What do you say you and I do a little mingling? All right, I'll, uh, catch up with you later. Oh, my gosh. Rachel, honey... ...are you okay? Where's Paolo? Rome. Jerk missed his flight. And then your face exploded? No. Okay. I was at the airport getting into a cab... ...when this woman... ...this blond planet with a pocketbook... ...starts yelling at me.
