Chunk: chunk_00001
Subtitles: Guys? There's, uh, somebody I'd like you to meet. [PHOEBE & RACHEL GASP] Wait, wait. What is that? That would be Marcel. You wanna say hi? No. No, I don't. Oh, he is precious. Where did you get him? My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab. That is so cruel. Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel? Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on his ass. Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment? Yeah. I mean, it's been kind of quiet since Carol left, so... Why don't you just get a roommate? Ah, I don't know. You reach a certain age... ...having a roommate is just kind of pathe... Uh, sorry, that's "pathet," which is Sanskrit for "really cool way to live."
