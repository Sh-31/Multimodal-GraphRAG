Subtitles: Oh, look at that. I did know how to tell you. [MUMBLING] Hey, everybody, the ball is going. GROUP: What? The ball is dropping. CLARK [ON TV]: In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight. And the moment of joy is upon us. Looks like that "no-date pact" thing worked out. Everybody looks so happy. I hate that. Not everybody is happy. Hey, Bobby. [SOBBING] GROUP: One. Happy New Year! You know, I just thought I'd throw this out there. I'm no math whiz... ...but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. Oh, I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight. I can't kiss anyone. So I'm kissing everyone? No, no, no. You can't kiss Ross. That's your brother. Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me. All right. Somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me. It's midnight. Somebody kiss me. It's midnight.
