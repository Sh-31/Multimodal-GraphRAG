Subtitles: - Five. - Five. Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight. Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. Ha, ha. What's an elf to do? Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone... ...when the ball drops? Oh, come on. We'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who. Hey, you know, this is so not what I needed now. - What's the matter? - Oh, it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, you know? He's walking around all the time, dragging his hands. That's so weird. I had such a blast with him the other night. - Really? - Yeah, we played. We watched TV. That juggling thing is amazing. What, uh? What juggling thing? With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that. No. You know, it wasn't that big a deal. I mean, just balled-up socks. And a melon.
