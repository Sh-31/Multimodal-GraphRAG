Chunk: chunk_00003
Subtitles: Might want to open with the snowman. GROUP: Hey, Joey. - Hey. ROSS: Hey, Joe. - So how'd it go? Ah, I didn't get the job. [GROUP GROANS] How could you not get it? You were Santa last year. I don't know. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly. It's all political. So, what are you gonna be? I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, you know? Do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? [GROUP SHOUTING] Gee, what? What is wrong with New Year's? Nothing for you. You have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday... ...desperate scramble to find anything with lips... ...just so can have somebody to kiss when the ball drops. Man, I'm talking loud. Well, for your information, Paolo's gonna be in Rome this New Year's. So I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. Yeah, you wish.
