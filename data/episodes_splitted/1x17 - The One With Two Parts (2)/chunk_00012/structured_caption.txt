See, I was supposed to get married... ...but, um, I left the guy at the altar. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but, heh... ...hey, that's me. - Why don't you try the hummus? RACHEL: Ahem. So, Monica, what do you do? Uh, I am a, uh, chef at a restaurant uptown. - Oh, good for you. - Yeah, it is. Mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
