Chunk: chunk_00004
Subtitles: I know I've gotta do something because the Tampa Bay defense is coming right at me. Tampa Bay's got a terrible team. Right, but... ...it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinking they can take us. And so I, uh, heh... I just heave it downfield. What are you, crazy? That's a baby. He should take the sack? Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield. And I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there's no way I'm not gonna get there in time. So I am running and I'm running... ...and that is when I woke up. See, I am so not ready to be a father. Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad. Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking. Oh. Have either of you ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it expensive?
