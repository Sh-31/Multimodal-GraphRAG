Subtitles: Well, it turns out we need a whole new one. Because, um, you see... ...I put the wrong name again. - Because, um... - You're that stupid. I am. I'm that stupid. Yeah, and I'm just gonna pay for this with a check. You know, your insurance will cover that. Yeah, I know. I'm just not that bright either. Okay, worst case scenario: - Say you never feel like a father. - Uh-huh. Say your son never feels connected to you as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this. Do you have a point? You know, you'd think I would. [MARCEL GASPING] What's up with the simian? It's just a fur ball. Okay, whose turn is it? Yours. I just got 43 points for "kidney." No, you got zero points for "idney." I had a K. Where's my K?
