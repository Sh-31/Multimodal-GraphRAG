Chunk: chunk_00011
Subtitles: - Um... - Stat. Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? - I mean, I think it'll be fine. - It will not. We'll get in trouble. Monica, would you stop being such a wuss? A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world. - So? - So they still seem normal. That's because they are. You have to admit, when we go out with women we meet at the hospital... Would you relax? Take a look around. There are no pagan altars. No piles of bones in the corners. They're fine. Go like this: I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a big baby. - I am not a baby. - Be serious. - You get uptight... - You act like a princess. - You know what? You know what? - What? What? Every day you are becoming more and more like your mother. Excuse me. Hello, here we go. This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
