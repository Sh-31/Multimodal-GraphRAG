Subtitles: Oh, my God. This was not at all scary. Hi, everybody. Hi, Betty. Betty, hi. You found Betty. Oh, my gosh. This is so great. Everybody I love is in the same room. Where's Joey?

I'm not freaking out. I'm just saying... ...if someone had come to me with the idea... Dad, Dad, Dad. I'm talking about the whole, uh, baby thing. Did you, uh, ever get this sort of... ...panicky, "Oh, my God, I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
