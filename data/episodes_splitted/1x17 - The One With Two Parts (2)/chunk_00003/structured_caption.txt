Subtitles: Who did I just put as my "in case of emergency" person? That's insurance fraud. Well, all right, then. Forget it. Might as well just go home. - Ow, ow, ow, ow! - Okay, okay. - Okay, come here. I hate this. - Thank you. I love you. Hi, heh. Um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms. Why? [LAUGHING] I am really an idiot. You see, I was filling out my friend's form... ...and instead of putting her information... ...I put mine. You are an idiot. Yep, that's me. Heh. I am that stupid. I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid. - That's nice. - That's nice. No, no. With him. I'm on this field, and they hike me the baby. I know I've gotta do something because the Tampa Bay defense is coming right at me.
