Subtitles: - Ross, you don't know that. - Oh, come on. It's cold, it's dark. He doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. Oh, my... I have no monkey and a broken foot. Thank you very much. Ross, you know, I've said I'm sorry, like, a million times. What do you want me to do? Huh? You want me to break my foot too? Here, I'm gonna break my foot right now. Ow! Oh, my God. There, are you happy now? Yeah, yeah. You know, now that you kicked the sign... ...hey, ha, ha, I don't miss Marcel anymore. You know, it's not like I did this on purpose. No, no, no. No, no. This is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel Land, doing your Rachel thing... ...totally oblivious to people's monkeys or to people's feelings and... - I don't even want to hear it. - Ross. - Forget it, okay? - Ross. What? What? Hey, banana man.
