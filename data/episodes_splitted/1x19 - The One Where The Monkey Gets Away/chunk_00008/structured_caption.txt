Chunk: chunk_00008
Subtitles: Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right, Marcel? Because... Marcel? Marcel? Marc...? - How could you lose him? - I don't know, I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe... Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one? I don't know. The left one. Which ones? Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything. - Hey. GROUP: Hey. Whoa, oh. Why is the air in here so negative? - Rachel lost Marcel. - Oh, no. How? - He pooped in my shoe. - Which one? Those cute little black ones I wear all the time. No, which one? Ha, ha. The right or left? Because the left one is lucky. Come on, you guys. What am I gonna do? All right, all right, all right. You're a monkey... ...you're loose in the city. Where do you go? Okay, it's his first time out... ...so he's probably gonna want to do some of the touristy things.
