He's gonna kill me. Start with the building. You take the first and second floor. Phoebe and I will take third and fourth. Whoa, whoa. What am I gonna do? Okay, you stay here and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe and wait for Ross to kill you. Does anybody want to trade? [SIGHS] What do you want? Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it? I left a Belgian waffle out here. Did you take it? No. Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall? I wasn't ready for it. The monkey, have you seen a monkey? I saw Regis Philbin once. Thank you, Mr. Heckles.
