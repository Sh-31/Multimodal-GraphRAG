Chunk: chunk_00023
Subtitles: - You see the von Trapp kids? - No. That's because I'm in front of them. Yeah, I thought that was an alp. Well, high school was not my favorite time. I don't know. I loved high school, you know? It was just, like, four years of parties and dating and sex and... Yeah, well, I went to boarding school with 400 boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice. Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago? Oh, oh, oh. Oh, my butt cheek is waking up.
