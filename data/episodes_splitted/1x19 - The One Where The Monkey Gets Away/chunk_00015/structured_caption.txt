Uh, we're kind of having an emergency, and, ahem, we were looking for something. - A monkey. - Yes, have you seen any? No. No, I haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators? Sure, sure. Did you try turning the knob back the other way? - Of course. - Oh. Then, no. Taste this daiquiri. Is there too much rum in here? Just a second. Hope you find your monkey. Oh, no, wait.
