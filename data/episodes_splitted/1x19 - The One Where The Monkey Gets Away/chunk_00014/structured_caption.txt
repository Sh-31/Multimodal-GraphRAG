Episode: 1x19 - The One Where The Monkey Gets Away
Chunk: chunk_00014
Subtitles: Luisa. From homeroom. Yes! - You have no idea who I am, do you? RACHEL: No. Not at all. Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. Would it have been so hard to say, "Morning, Luisa"... ...or "Nice overalls"? Oh, I'm so sorry. It's not so much you. You were fat. You had your own problems. But you. What a bitch. What? You know what? Be that as it may. You think you could you help us out here on that monkey thing, for old times' sake? Go, Bobcats. I could. But I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. [SINGING] Da, da, da Sorry.
