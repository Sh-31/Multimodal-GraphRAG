You can send it back whenever. - All right, I want my monkey. - No. - Oh, come on, Luisa. - Sorry, prom queen. You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't have been fat. All right, look, in high school, I was the prom queen... ...and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... ...were also there. Look, if you take this monkey... ...I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him.
