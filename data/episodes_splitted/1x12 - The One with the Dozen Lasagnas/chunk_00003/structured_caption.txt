Chunk: chunk_00003
Subtitles: Well, the meat's only every third layer. Maybe you could scrape. Ross, did you really read all these baby books? Yep. You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus... ...no compass... ...and I could find my way out like that. Ooh, this is cool. It says in some parts of the world people actually eat the placenta. And we're done with the yogurt. Sorry. Aunt Silv, I did this as a favor. I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Silv. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth? Hey, Ross, listen. Do you know that right now your baby is only this big? - This is your baby. - Heh. [IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] Hi, Daddy. Hello. How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady?
