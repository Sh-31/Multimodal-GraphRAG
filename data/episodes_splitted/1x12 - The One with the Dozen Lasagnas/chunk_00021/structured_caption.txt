Chunk: chunk_00021
Subtitles: I'm so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy. I don't want to think about another guy. I don't even want to be near another guy. [RACHEL SIGHS] Huh. - Ross, you're so great. - Oh, ha, ha. MONICA: Are you all right? PHOEBE: Are you okay? Medium. Heh. - Any cookies left? - Yeah. Heh. See, Rach, um... See, I don't think swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process. No. No. I just need to be by myself for a while. You know? I just gotta figure out what I want. No, no.
