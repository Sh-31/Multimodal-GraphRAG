We haven't known each other for that long a time. And, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life. Two, I never lie. And three, I make the best oatmeal-raisin cookies in the world. Okay. Thanks, Pheebs. Mm, my God. Why have I never tasted these before?
