I was laughed out of 12 interviews today. Yet you're surprisingly upbeat. Well, you would be too if you found Joan and David boots on sale... ...50 percent off. Oh, how well you know me. They're my new "I don't need a job or my parents. I've got great boots" boots. - How'd you pay for them? - Uh, credit card. And who pays for that? Um, my father. You can't live off your parents your whole life. I know that. That's why I was getting married. Give her a break. It's hard being on your own for the first time. - Thank you. - You're welcome.
