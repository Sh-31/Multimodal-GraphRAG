Episode: 1x01 - The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate 
Chunk: chunk_00005
Subtitles: - Hi. - Oh, God. [SIGHS] So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? Oh, God! Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding. I was in this room with all the presents... ...and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat. When all of a sudden... Sweet 'N Low? - I realized... ...I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry. Then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering: "Why am I doing this?" And "Who am I doing this for?" Anyway, I just didn't know where to go, and I know you and I have drifted apart... ...but you're the only person I know in the city.
