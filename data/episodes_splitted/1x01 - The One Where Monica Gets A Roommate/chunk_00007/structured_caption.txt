Episode: 1x01 - The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate 
Chunk: chunk_00007
Subtitles: It's like all of my life, everyone's always told me, "You're a shoe! You're a shoe! You're a shoe! You're a shoe!" Then today I stopped and said, "What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a purse? You know? Or a hat?" I don't want you to buy me a hat, I am a hat. It's a metaphor, Daddy! You can see where he'd have trouble. Look, Daddy, it's my life. Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. I guess we've established she's staying with Monica. Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait! Wait! I said maybe! Okay. Just breathe, that's it. Just try to think of nice, calm things. [SINGING] Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens
