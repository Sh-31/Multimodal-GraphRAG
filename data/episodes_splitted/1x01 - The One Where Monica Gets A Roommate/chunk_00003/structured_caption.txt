Subtitles: This guy says "hello," I wanna kill myself. Are you okay, sweetie? I feel like someone grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth... ...and tied it around my neck. - Cookie? Carol moved her stuff out today. PHOEBE & JOEY: Oh. - Let me get you some coffee. - Thanks. Ew. Unh. No. No, don't! Stop cleansing my aura. Just leave my aura alone, okay? I'll be fine. All right? Really. I hope she'll be very happy. - No, you don't. - No, I don't. To hell with her. She left me! And you never knew she was a lesbian. No! Okay? Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know. How should I know? Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
