Actually, thanks, but I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. - It's been a long day. - Oh, sure. Okay. Sure. Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help? Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to. I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things... ...using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no bracket-y thing, I see no worm guys whatsoever... ...and I cannot feel my legs. What's this? I have no idea. - Done with the bookcase. - All finished.
