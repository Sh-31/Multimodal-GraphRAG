Chunk: chunk_00011
Subtitles: - Done with the bookcase. - All finished. This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can. I should have known. Hey. Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV. What did you get? You guys. - Oh, God. Oh, my God. - You got screwed. - Oh, my God. - I know, I know. I'm such an idiot. I should've caught on when she went to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get? My brother's going through that. He's such a mess. How did you get through it? He might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers. - Say her... - Leg? Heh. That's one way of going through it, yeah. Me, I went for the watch. - You actually broke her watch? - Mm. Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry. You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't.
