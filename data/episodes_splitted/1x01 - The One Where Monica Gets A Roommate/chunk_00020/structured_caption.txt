Chunk: chunk_00020
Subtitles: - Thank you. - You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city, I was 14. My mom had killed herself and my stepdad was back in prison. And I got here, and I didn't know anybody. I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields... ...outside Port Authority. And then he killed himself. And then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. The word you're looking for is: "Anyway..." All right. You ready? - I don't think so. ROSS: Oh, come on. Cut. Cut. ALL: Cut, cut, cut. ROSS: Hey. MONICA: All right. Welcome to the real world. It sucks. You're gonna love it. [FRANCIS SCOTT KEY'S "STAR-SPANGLED BANNER" PLAYS ON TV] Well, that's it. You gonna crash on the couch?
