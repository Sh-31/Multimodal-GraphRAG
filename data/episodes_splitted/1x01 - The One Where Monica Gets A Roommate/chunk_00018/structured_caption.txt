Episode: 1x01 - The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate 
Chunk: chunk_00018
Subtitles: - Hey, Monica. - Hey, Franny. Welcome back. How was Florida? You had sex, didn't you? How do you do that? - So, who? - You know Paul? Paul, the wine guy? Oh, yeah, I know Paul. You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul? Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years. Of course it was a line. Why? Why would anybody do something like that? We're looking for an answer more sophisticated than: "To get you into bed." Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs... ...and men with severe emotional problems can hear? All right, come here. Give me your feet.
