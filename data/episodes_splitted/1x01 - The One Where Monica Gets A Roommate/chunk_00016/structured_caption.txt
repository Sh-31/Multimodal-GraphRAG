Chunk: chunk_00016
Subtitles: Thank you. That wasn't a real date. What the hell do you do on a real date? - Shut up and put my table back. JOEY: Okay. All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference. So, like, you guys all have jobs? Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff. Yeah, I'm an actor. Wow. Would I have seen you in anything? Oh, I doubt it. Mostly regional work. Unless you happened to catch the Wee One's production of Pinocchio. "Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy." I will not take this abuse. You're right. I'm sorry.
