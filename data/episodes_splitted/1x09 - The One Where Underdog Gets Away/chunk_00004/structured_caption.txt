Subtitles: That's funny, I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man/woman. What were you modeling for? You know those posters for the City Free Clinic? Oh, wow. You're gonna be one of those healthy, healthy, healthy guys? - Ah? - The asthma guy's really cute. - Oh, he is. RACHEL: Isn't he? - You know which one you're gonna be? - No, no. But I hear Lyme disease is open, so, you know... Good luck, man. I hope you get it. Thanks. Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving. Aw. Tell you what. How about if I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's. Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps? You know they're not actually supposed to...? I'll work on the lumps. - Joey, you're going home, right? - Yeah. And I assume, Chandler, you're still boycotting all the Pilgrim holidays? Yes, every single one of them. Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma? Yeah, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December because he's lunar.
