Ding, ding, ding. ALL: Mm. This isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving you planned... ...but for me this has been really great, you know? I think because it didn't involve divorce... ...or projectile vomiting. I was just thinking, if you'd gone to Vail... ...or if you guys had been with your family, or if you didn't have... ...syphilis and stuff... ...we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say... ...is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. RACHEL & JOEY: That's so sweet. RACHEL: Thank you. ROSS: Mm.
