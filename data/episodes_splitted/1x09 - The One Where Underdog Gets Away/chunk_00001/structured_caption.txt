Subtitles: Terry, I know I haven't worked here very long... ...but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible... ...if I got a $100 advance on my salary? An advance? It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year, we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket... ...but I've sort of started this whole independent thing, you know... ...which is actually why I took this "job." Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful. Okay, I hear what you're saying. I'm with you. Um... But I'm trying really hard, and I think I'm doing better.
