Chunk: chunk_00007
Subtitles: The baby that hasn't been born yet? Uh, wouldn't that mean you're... ...crazy? What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there? You're not serious. I mean, you really talk to it? Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice. Do you, uh...? Do you talk about me? - Yeah, yeah. All the time. - Really? But, um, we just refer to you as "Bobo the sperm guy." Look, if she's talking to it, I just think I should get some belly time too. I mean, not that I believe any of this. Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. - Really? - I can show you. This will seem a little weird. But you put your head inside this turkey... ...and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
