Subtitles: This is... It's too weird. I feel stupid. All right, so don't do it. It's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it. Hello, baby. Hello, hello. - That moment when we first saw the giant dog shadow fall over the park? But did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean. Okay, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside... ...and juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here? We're waiting for you to open the door. You've got the keys. No, I don't. Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "Got the keys." No, I didn't. I asked, "Got the keys?" No, no, no. You said, "Got the keys." Either of you have the keys? - The oven is on. - Oh, I've gotta get my ticket. - Wait. We have a copy of your key. - Well, then get it, get it! Hey, hey. That tone won't make me go any faster.
