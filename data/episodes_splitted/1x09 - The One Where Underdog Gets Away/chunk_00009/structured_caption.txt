Subtitles: Thank you. Thank you so much. Chandler, here you go. Got your traditional holiday feast. Got your tomato soup... ...your grilled-cheese fixings, and your family-size bag of Funyuns. Wait, this is what you're having for Thanksgiving dinner? What is it with you and this holiday? [SIGHS] All right, I'm 9 years old. - Aw. - Aw, I hate this story. We've just finished Thanksgiving dinner. I have... And I remember this part vividly. - A mouthful of pumpkin pie. And this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced. Oh, my God. It's very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. Hi. - We used to work together. - We did? Yeah, at Macy's. You're the Obsession girl, right?
