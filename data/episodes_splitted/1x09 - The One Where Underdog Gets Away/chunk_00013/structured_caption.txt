Chunk: chunk_00013
Subtitles: Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff. Chandler, will you just come in, already? No, thank you. I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment. Look out. Incoming pumpkin pie. [MIMICS PLANE ZOOMING] Okay, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore. Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any Tater Tots. That's not a question. But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a Tot. I mean, it's bad enough I can't be with my family... ...because of my disease. All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps... ...and in the form of Tots. Yes. All right, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. - Ah. - Okay, Mom never hit.
