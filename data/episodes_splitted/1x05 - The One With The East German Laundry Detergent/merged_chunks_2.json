Chandler's confident, albeit possibly exaggerated, descriptions of his romantic prowess at the restaurant provide insight into his character and potential plot points.\n*   **Notable Transitions:** A significant transition occurs from the personal interactions at Central Perk and the laundromat to the more social setting of the restaurant. Another brief transition moves from the restaurant to the restroom."
