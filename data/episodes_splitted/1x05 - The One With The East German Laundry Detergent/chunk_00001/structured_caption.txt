Chunk: chunk_00001
Subtitles: Would you let it go? It's not a big deal. ROSS: Not a big deal? It's amazing. You just reach in, there's one little maneuver, and bam! A bra. Right out the sleeve. As far as I'm concerned... ...there is nothing a guy can do that comes close. Right? Come on! You guys can pee standing up. We can? Okay, I'm trying that. You know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts anytime they want. You just look down, and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me. What I don't get is the way guys can do so many mean things... ...and then not even care. Multiple orgasms!
