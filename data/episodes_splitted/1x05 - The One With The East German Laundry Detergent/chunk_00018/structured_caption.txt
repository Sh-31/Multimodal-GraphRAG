It can happen to anyone. But it didn't. It happened to me. God, I'm gonna look like a big Marshmallow Peep! What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right! I can't live on my own. I can't even do laundry! [WOMAN LAUGHS] [NIBBLING] Something went wrong with Underdog... ...and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway... ...his head is, like, flopping down Broadway.
