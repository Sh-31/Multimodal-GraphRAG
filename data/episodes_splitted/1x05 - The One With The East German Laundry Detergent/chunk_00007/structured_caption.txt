He's Angela's... ...ahem, brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated... ...and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is... - Oh, God, help us. - What? Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile. BOTH: Ew! Look, I'm asking a favor here. I'm thinking if I do this for her brother... ...maybe Angela will come back to me. What's going on here?
