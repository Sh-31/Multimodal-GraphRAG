Subtitles: Nothing. I'm fine. What's the matter? Why so scrunchie? It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible. That guy, he burns me up. Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. It was horrible! He called me "young lady." Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that. Did he give you that whole "You're not up to this" thing again? Yeah, I got the extended disco version with three choruses of: "You'll never make it on your own." [SINGS] Uh-huh, uh-huh Hi, Joey. Oh, my God. Angela. Wow. Being dumped by you obviously agrees with her. - Are you gonna go over there? - No. Yeah. No. Okay, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi...
