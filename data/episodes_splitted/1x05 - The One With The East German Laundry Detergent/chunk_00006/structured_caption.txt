Chunk: chunk_00006
Subtitles: I do have a laundry room in my building. Um... But there's a rat problem. Apparently, they're attracted to the dryer sheets. They're going in fine, but they're coming out all... ...fluffy. Anyway, 7-ish? Sure. Forget it, Joey. I'm with Bob now. Bob? Who the hell's Bob? Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor. But Bob... Come on. We were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but, like, talking too. Sorry, Joey. You said, "Let's just be friends." So guess what? - What? - We're just friends. Fine. Fine. So why don't the four of us go out and have dinner tonight? You know, as friends.
