Chances are he's going to be this broken shell of a man. You know? So you should try not to look too terrific. I know it'll be hard. Or, you know, hey, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring. And you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB-GYN. You've got Carol tomorrow. When did it get so complicated? Got me. - Remember when we were in high school? - Yeah. I mean, didn't you think you' were gonna meet someone... ...fall in love, and that'd be it? [SCOFFS]
