Chunk: chunk_00008
Subtitles: Oh, that is not a happy "hi." Carol's pregnant. Oh, I found it. Well, what...? What? Yeah. Do that for another two hours... ...you might be where I am right about now. Kind of puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? Well, now, how do you fit into this whole thing? Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved. But if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved. Basically, it's totally up to me. She is so great. I miss her. What does she mean by "involved"? I mean, presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. Anyway, they want me to go down to this... ...sonogram thing with them tomorrow. So, what are you gonna do? I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
