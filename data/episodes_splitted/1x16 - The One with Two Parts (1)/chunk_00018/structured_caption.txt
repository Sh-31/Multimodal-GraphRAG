I know it's frightening. But big picture: The birth part is just one day... ...and when it's over, we'll all be parents for the rest of our lives. SUSAN: I mean, that's what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross. I'm gonna be a father. - This is just occurring to you? - I always knew I was having a baby. I just never realized the baby was having me. Oh, you're gonna be great.
