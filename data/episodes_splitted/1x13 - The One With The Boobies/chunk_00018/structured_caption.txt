Chunk: chunk_00018
Subtitles: There's chicken in there. Put it away. For God's sake, Joey. Really. Hold on. You knew? Of course I knew. What do you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should have heard his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's." I mean, what is that? Please. So then, how could you...? Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling. Nothing made him happy. Not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle. Now he's happy. I mean, it's nice. He has a hobby. Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... ...what the hell are you talking about? - I mean, what about you? - Me? I'm fine. Look, honey... ...in an ideal world... ...there'd be no her and your father would look like Sting.
