Subtitles: Hey, kickie. - What are you doing? - Trying to get comfortable. - I can't sleep in my underwear. - Well, you're gonna. I've been thinking... ...about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls. Are they end-to-end, or tall, like pancakes? You know what I mean. How I date all these women. I always figured, when the right one comes along... ...I'll be able to be a standup guy and go the distance, you know? Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking... You're not him, you're you. When they wanted you to go into your father's business, did you cave? - No. - No. You decided to go into the out-of-work-actor business. That wasn't easy, but you did it.
