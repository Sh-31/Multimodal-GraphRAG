Chunk: chunk_00006
Subtitles: Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician. Sure. So how long have you been... Remember when you were a kid, I'd take you to the Navy yard... ...and show you the big ships? - Since then? - No, it's only been six years. I wanted to give you a nice memory... ...so you'd know I wasn't always such a terrible guy. Joe, have you ever been in love? I don't know. Then you haven't. - You're burning your tomatoes. - Hmm. You're one to talk. Joe, your dad's in love, bigtime. And the worst part is, it's with two different women. Oh, man. Please tell me one of them is Ma. Of course one of them's Ma. What's the matter with you?
