Oh, please. If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond... ...chasing after 20-year-old boys... ...or I'll end up like my mom. - Hey. ALL: Hey, Pheebs. MONICA: How's it going? Okay, except I broke up with Roger. ALL: Oh. Yeah, right. ALL: No, no, really. Aw. - What happened? - Ugh. I don't know. I mean... He's a good person... ...and he can be really sweet. And in some ways, I think he is so right for me. It's just, I hate that guy.
