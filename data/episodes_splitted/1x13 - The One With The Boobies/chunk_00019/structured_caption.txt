Subtitles: ...there'd be no her and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else: Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along... ...he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive. He's been more loving. It's like every day is our anniversary. I'm happy for you? Well, don't be. Because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was. JOEY: Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want. I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me... Did you see her? Yeah. You're 10 times prettier than she is. That's sweet. Could I take her?
