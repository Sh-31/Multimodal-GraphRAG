Chunk: chunk_00003
Subtitles: He's so sweet. And so complicated, you know? And for a shrink, he's not too "shrinky." You know? So you think you'll do it on his couch? Oh. I don't know. That's a little weird. It's vinyl. - Okay. You guys want anything else? - Oh, yes. - Could I have...? - Sorry, we're all out. - Anybody else? - Okay. Did I, uh, miss something? No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies. What were you doing seeing her boobies? It was an accident. I wasn't across the street with a telescope and a box of doughnuts. [ROGER LAUGHS] Can we change the subject, please? Because, hello? These aren't her "boobies." These are her breasts. Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change. I don't know why you're embarrassed. They were very nice boobies. "Nice"? They were "nice"? That's it? I mean, mittens are "nice."
