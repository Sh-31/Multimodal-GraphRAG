Episode: 1x13 - The One With The Boobies
Chunk: chunk_00009
Subtitles: - Ha, ha. - Why? Why would I? Why? Why? Why? Why? I don't know. Maybe low self-esteem? Maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe... Wait. Go back to that "sibling" thing. Well, I don't know. It's conceivable that you sabotaged your marriage... ...so the sibling would be less of a failure in the parents' eyes. [CHUCKLES] That's ridiculous. I don't feel guilty for her failures. - Oh, so you think I'm a failure? - Isn't he good? Yeah. No. That's not what I was saying. All these years, I thought you were on my side... ...but maybe you were sucking up to Mom and Dad... ...so they'd favor you. Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good. You're right. I mean, you're right.
