Subtitles: Hey. Can, uh... Can we help you? Oh. No, thanks. I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani. I'm Joey Tribbiani. Oh. Oh, no, not you. Big Joey. Oh, my God. You're so much cuter than your pictures. I'm Ronni. Cheese Nip? Uh, Joey's having an embolism... ...but I'd go for a Nip. You see, most people, when their pets pass on... ...they want them laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get a person who wants them in a pose. Like, uh, chasing their tail. Or, uh, jumping to catch a Frisbee. Joey, if I go first, I want to be looking for my keys. [RONNI LAUGHS]
