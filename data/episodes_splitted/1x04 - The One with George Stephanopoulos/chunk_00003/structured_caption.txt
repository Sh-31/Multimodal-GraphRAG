My grandmother has this new boyfriend... ...and they're both kind of insecure in bed, so... And deaf. So they're constantly having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are. - You can stay with Rachel and me tonight. - Thanks. Ninety-five, 96, 97. See, I told you. Less than 100 steps from our place to here. You got way too much free time, man. Hey, there's the birthday boy. Ross, check it out. Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins tonight at the Garden. We're taking you. - Happy birthday, pal. - We love you, man. [ROSS CHUCKLES] It's funny, my birthday was seven months ago. - So? - So I'm guessing you had an extra ticket...
