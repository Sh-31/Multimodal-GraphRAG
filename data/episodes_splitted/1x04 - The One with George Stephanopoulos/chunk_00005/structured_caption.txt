Subtitles: All right, all right. Maybe it will take my mind off it. - You promise to buy me a big foam finger? JOEY: You got it. - All right. - Look, look, look. My first paycheck. [ALL CHATTERING] Look at the window. There's my name. Hi, me. I remember the day I got my first paycheck. There was a cave-in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. Wow, you worked in a mine? No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why? God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk for it. And it was totally... ...not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what...? Chandler, look at that. Oh, this is not that bad. Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. - You can totally, totally live on this. MONICA: Oh, yeah, yeah. By the way, great service today.
