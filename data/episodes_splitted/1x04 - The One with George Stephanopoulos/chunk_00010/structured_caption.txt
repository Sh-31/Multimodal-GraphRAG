Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been unusual activity on your account. - But I haven't used my card in weeks. - That is the unusual activity. They just wanna see if you're okay. They wanna know if I'm okay? Okay, they wanna know if I'm okay. Okay, let's see. Well, let's see. The FICA guys took all my money. Everyone I know is either getting married or getting pregnant or getting promoted... ...and I'm getting coffee. And it's not even for me. So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay. Okay? Uh, Rachel has left the building. - Can you call back? - All right. Come on.
