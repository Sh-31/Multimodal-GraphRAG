Um, oh, and sometimes Arturo lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies. Well, your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies. [WHIRRING] MONICA: Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? [MONICA & PHOEBE SHRIEK] Okay, how would you like some Tiki Death Punch? What's that? - Well, it's rum and... - Okay. We thought since Phoebe's staying over we'd have a slumber party.
