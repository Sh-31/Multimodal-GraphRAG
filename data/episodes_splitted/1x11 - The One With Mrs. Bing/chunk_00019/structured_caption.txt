Subtitles: - Sorry. - I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you. We both have. - So the Etch A Sketch is from you guys? - Actually, it's just from me. - Yeah, I got you the foot massager. - Know who shaved you? That was me. - I read to you. - I sang. Ha. Well, thanks. - Oh, my pleasure. - You're welcome. So I guess I'll see you around. What? That's it? "See you around"? - Well, what do you want me to say? - Well, I don't know. Maybe, uh: "That was nice. It meant something to me. I'll call you." - All right. I'll call you. - I don't think you mean that. This is so typical. You know, we give... ...and we give... ...and we give. And then we just get nothing back. And then one day, it's just, you know, you wake up and "See you around."
