I'm gonna take a short break. RACHEL: Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Whoo! - What the hell was that? - Phoebe just started... I believe I was talking to Joey. All right, there, mother-kisser? [LAUGHING] "Mother-kisser." I'll shut up. Chandler, can I say something? I know you're still mad at me. I just wanna say that there were two people there that night, okay? - There were two sets of lips. - Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
