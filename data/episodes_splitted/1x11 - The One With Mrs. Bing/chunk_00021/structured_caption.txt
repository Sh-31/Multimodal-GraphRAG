Chunk: chunk_00021
Subtitles: - Are we okay now? - Yeah. No. No. Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door. Shh. He did it. He told her off. And not just about the kiss, about everything. - You're kidding? - No. He said, "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?" - Wow. - Wait, then she came back with: "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realize I have a bomb?" Okay, wait. Are you sure she didn't say: "When are you gonna grow up and realize I am your mom?" - That makes more sense. - You think? Yeah. So, what's going on now? I don't know. I've been standing here spelling it out for you. I don't hear anything. Wait, wait, wait. What do you see? It's hard to tell. They're so tiny and upside down. Wait, wait, wait. They're walking away. They're walking away.
