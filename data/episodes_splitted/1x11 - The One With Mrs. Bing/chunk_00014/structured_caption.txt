Subtitles: How would I know? I wasn't here. Really? Not even to, um, change his pajamas? Oh, my God. You're my friend. I had to tell you. I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom? Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink. I mean, you know how he gets when he's drunk... I can't do this. I did it. It was me. I'm sorry. I kissed your mom. What? I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo and I think I had too much tequila... ...and Nora... Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was... She was just being nice, you know? But nothing happened. Nothing. Ask Joey. Joey came in... - You knew about this? - Uh... You know, knowledge is a tricky thing. I spent the entire day with you. Why didn't you tell me? Hey, hey. You're lucky I caught them when I did... ...or else who knows what would've happened? Thanks, man. Big help.
