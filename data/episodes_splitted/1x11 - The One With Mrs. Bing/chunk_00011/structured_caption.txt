Yeah, well, you don't have your racquet. No. No, I don't, because it's being restrung. Ahem. Somebody was supposed to bring me one. Yeah. Well, you didn't call and leave your grip size. Okay, you guys are spending way too much time together. Okay, I'm scum. I'm scum. - Ross, how could you let this happen? - I don't know. Well, it's not like she's a regular mom. You know? She's sexy.
