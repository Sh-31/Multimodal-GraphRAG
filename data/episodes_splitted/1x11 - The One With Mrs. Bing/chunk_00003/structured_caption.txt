I wish all guys could be like him. I know. Are there no conscious men in the city for you two? - He doesn't have anyone. - Yeah. We feel kind of responsible. I can't believe you said, "Woo-hoo." I don't even say, "Woo-hoo." Oh, she's coming up. She's coming up. Folks, when we come back... ...we'll talk about her new book Euphoria Unbound... ...with always-interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
