Subtitles: What is this about you being arrested in London? What is that about? - Your mom was arrested? - Shh, I'm busy beaming with pride. This is kind of embarrassing... ...but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man... - Why would she say that's embarrassing? - Shh. - I just get this craving for Kung Pao chicken. That's too much information. So now you're doing this book tour thing. How's that going? Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate. But I get to see my son, who I love. GROUP: Oh. This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone. You know, don't take this wrong, I just don't see you as a mom somehow. - I don't mean that bad. - Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom. I bought my son his first condoms. And then he burst into flames.
