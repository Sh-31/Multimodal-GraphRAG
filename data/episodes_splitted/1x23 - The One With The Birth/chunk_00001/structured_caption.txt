Chunk: chunk_00001
Subtitles: WOMAN [OVER PA]: Dr. Johnson, you have a call on line 7. She's not here yet. She's having my baby and she's not here. - Everything's fine. Has her water broken? - I don't know. But when I spoke to her, she said she'd already passed the mucus plug. [GROANS] Do we have to know about that? What are you gonna do when you have a baby? I'm gonna be in the waiting room, handing out cigars. Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the '50s. Aah, I don't believe this. I mean, she could be giving birth in the cab. Oh, Ross, relax. It's only like $2 for the first contraction... ...and then 50 cents each additional contraction. What, it's okay when Chandler does it? You have to pick your moments. - Hi. Did I miss it? Did I miss it? - No, she's not even here yet. - Oh. MONICA: What's with the guitar? I just thought we might be here for a while, so, you know, things might get musical.
