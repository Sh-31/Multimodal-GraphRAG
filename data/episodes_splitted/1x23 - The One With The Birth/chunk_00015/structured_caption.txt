My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know? Instead I'm stuck in a closet with you. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have. Believe me, no one has been waiting for this as much as I have, okay? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby. - Where does that leave me? - You get to be the father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Father's Day. There's Mother's Day. There's no Lesbian Lover Day. Every day is Lesbian Lover Day. This is so great.
