Chunk: chunk_00016
Subtitles: You wanna explain that? I mean, well, because when I was growing up, you know, my dad left... ...and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail. So I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents... ...who care about it so much that they fight over who gets to love it the most... ...and it's not even born yet. It's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry. You were fighting. Where are they? - I'm sure they'll be here soon. - They wouldn't miss this. Relax. You're only at nine centimeters, and the baby's at zero station. Okay, you are really frightening me. [CAROL SCREAMS] Somebody wanna help me? Trying to rip out my heart. Uh... Oh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
