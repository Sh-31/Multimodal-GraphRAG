It's a whole big "bone" thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for, like, a week. So, uh, if you wanna reach me, you can't. So here's my itinerary. Um... - Here's a picture of me. - Oh, let me see. Could you take it to Carol's now and then and show it to Ben so he doesn't forget me? - Yeah. - Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am The Head! Pahh! This barbecue's gonna be very fun. Is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left. - Oh, no, she's out having drinks with Carl. - Oh. Heh. Hey, who's Carl? - The guy she met at the coffeehouse? - No.
