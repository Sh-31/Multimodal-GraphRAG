Chunk: chunk_00017
Subtitles: You know how you think you're great in bed? The fact you'd even ask shows how little you know me. Well, it's like, last night I couldn't do the thing... ...that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got! Man, oh, man. It was like a ticker-tape parade! Yes I know. As it happens, my room is very close to the parade route. It was amazing, and not just for her. Uh-uh. For me too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind... ...but all my other senses are heightened. You know? It's like, I was able to appreciate it... ...on another level. I didn't know you had another level. I know. Neither did I!
