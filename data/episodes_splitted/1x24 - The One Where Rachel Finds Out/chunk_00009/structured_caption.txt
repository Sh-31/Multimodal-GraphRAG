Subtitles: Wow. Thank you. This one's from Joey. It feels like a book. I think it's a book. Feels like a book. And it's a book! It's Dr. Seuss! That book got me through some tough times. There is a little child inside this man. The doctors say if they remove it, he'll die. - Who's this from? - That's, uh, Ross'. Ah. [CLEARS THROAT] Oh, my God. He remembered. Remembered what? It was, like, months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window. I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was little. Aw! I can't believe he remembered! Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
