At gate 27B? Uh, yeah. Monica, you know, I've been thinking about it. I've decided this Ross thing is not a good idea. - Why? - Because I feel... ...like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. - Ugh, there'd be all this pressure and... - No pressure, no pressure! Nothing has even happened yet and you're already so... I'm not "so." I was a teensy bit weird at first... ...but I'll be good. I promise. [DOOR BUZZING] Who is it? CARL: It's me, Carl. Come on up. Behind my brother's back?
