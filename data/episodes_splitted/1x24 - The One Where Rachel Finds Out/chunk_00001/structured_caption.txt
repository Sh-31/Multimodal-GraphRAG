You must just want to kiss him all over. That would be nice. - Pfft. - Pardon? Nothing. Just a little extra air in my mouth. Pfft. Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back. Oh, yeah, right. Including the waffles last week... ...you now owe me... ...17 jillion dollars. I will, really, I'll pay you back this time. Where's the money coming from? I'm helping out at the NYU Med School with some, uh, research. What kind of research? Uh, just, you know, science.
