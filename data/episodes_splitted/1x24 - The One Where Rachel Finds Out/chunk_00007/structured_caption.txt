And I may only have a couple beers in me, but I love you, man. I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice. Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this fruit-basket business. We call ourselves "The Three Basketeers." Ha, ha. Like "The Three Musketeers," only with fruit. Oh! Okay. - How do you like your burgers? - No. Presents first, food later! Hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up? Well, not so good. She thinks tonight's the night we're gonna complete the transaction...
