Chunk: chunk_00008
Subtitles: - Yeah. - Yes, and I get my ya-yas from lkea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less. Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, all right? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a nice guy. Okay, because once those cards are dealt... Yeah? I'm not a nice guy. All right, boys. Let's eat. Ah, did you get that from the "I Love Rachel" pizzeria? - You still on that? - Come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy". You're way off, pal.
