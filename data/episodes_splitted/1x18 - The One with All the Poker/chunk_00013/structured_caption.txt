Chunk: chunk_00013
Subtitles: So Pheebs owes 7.50. Monica, you owe $10. And, Rachel, you owe 15 big ones. Thanks for teaching us "Crossed-eyed Mary." You guys, we gotta play that other way. All right, here's my 7.50, but I think you should know that this money is cursed. - What? - Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it. That's all right, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way, I can break them up with a movie. So that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes 15. Hmm, oh, it's so typical: "Ooh, I'm a man. Ooh, I have a penis. Ooh, I have to win money to exert my power over women." You know what? This is not over. We will play you again. And we will win and you will lose.
