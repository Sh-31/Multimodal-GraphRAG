Subtitles: Where were we? Oh. Okay. Five card draw. Uh, jacks are better. Nothing wild, everybody ante. Look, Rach, we don't have to do this. Yes, we do. - All right. Check. - Check. I'm in for 50 cents. - Call. - I'm in. I see your 50 cents... ...and I raise you... ...$5. I thought, uh, it was a 50-cent limit. Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet 5 bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that? - Not at all. - No, no. [MONICA CLEARS THROAT] Loser? No, I fold. What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on, what is this? I thought that, "Once the cards are dealt, I'm not a nice guy."
