Subtitles: Okay, Joey, your bet. I fold, like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach... ...by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out. - Ross? - Oh, I'm very in. - Chandler? - Couldn't be more out. Me too. Rachel? Um, I will see you and I'll raise you. What do you say? You wanna waste another buck? No, not this time. - So, what did you have? - I'm not telling. - Come on, show them to me. - No. - Show them to me. Let me see. - Get your hands out of there. You know, I've had dates like this. Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red. Little veins popping out of your temple. Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
