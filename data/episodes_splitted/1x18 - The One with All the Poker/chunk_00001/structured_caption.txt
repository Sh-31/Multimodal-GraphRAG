Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for. Hey, look, you guys. I'm going for anything here, okay? I can't be a waitress anymore. I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips. I'm sick of being called "Excuse Me." Rach, did you proofread these? Uh, yeah. Why? Uh, nothing. I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent "compuper" skills. Oh, my God! Oh, do you think it's on all of them? Oh, no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.
