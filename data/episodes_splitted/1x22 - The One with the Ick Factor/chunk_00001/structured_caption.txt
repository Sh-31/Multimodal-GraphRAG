All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream... ...that, um, you and I were, uh... Doing it on this table. - Wow. - Excellent dream score. Why...? Why would you dream that? More importantly, was I any good? Well, you were pretty damned good. Ha, ha. Interesting, because in my dreams, I'm surprisingly inadequate.
