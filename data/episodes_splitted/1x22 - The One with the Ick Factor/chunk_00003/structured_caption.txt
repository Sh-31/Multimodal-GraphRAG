Just for some short-term work. You know, till I get back some of my massage clients. Pirates again? No. Nothing like that. I'm just such a dummy. I taught this "Massage Yourself at Home" workshop. And they are. Hey, hey, Chan, she could work for you. Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea. What? I could. I could do it. What is it? Well, my secretary's gonna be out. She's having one of her boobs reduced. It's a whole big boob story. I could be a secretary. Well, I don't know if it's your kind of thing... ...because, uh, it involves a lot of being normal...
