Chunk: chunk_00004
Subtitles: ...because, uh, it involves a lot of being normal... ...ahem, for a large portion of the day. I could do that. [BEEPER BEEPING] - What are you playing with? - It's my new beeper. Why the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for? Is it, like, for dinosaur emergencies? "Help, come quick! They're still extinct!" [CHANDLER LAUGHS] No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. All she has to do is dial 55-JIMBO. A cool phone number and a possible name for the kid. - I'll see you guys later. - Off to see young Ethan? Thank you. How young is young Ethan? Young? He's our age. When we were? - Okay, he's a senior in college. - College? JOEY: Ooh. - Whoa. And this man-child has no problem with how old you are? No, of course not. It's not even an issue... ...because I told him I was 22.
