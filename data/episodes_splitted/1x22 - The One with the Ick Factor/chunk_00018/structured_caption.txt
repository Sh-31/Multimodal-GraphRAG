Subtitles: CHANDLER: I think last night was great. You know, the karaoke thing? Tracy and I doing "Ebony and lvory"? - Mm-hm. - Ha, ha. You were great. But they still made fun of you. - What? - Now you're more like Mr. Caring-Boss. Mr. "I'm-One-of-You"-Boss. Mr. "I-Wanna-Be-Your-Buddy"- Boss-Man-Bing. Then I don't get it.

You're the one that hires them and fires them. - They still say you're a great boss. - They do? Uh-huh. But they're not your friends anymore. - But I just want to... - No, but you can't. - But I just want... - Ah-ah. [BEEPER BEEPING] Aren't you gonna...? Oh, Carol and I have a new system.
