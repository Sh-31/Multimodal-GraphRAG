Subtitles: Okay. Uh... How about these? That's really a day shoe. And where she's going, everyone else will be dressier? Could we see something in a slimmer heel? Okay. I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work. No, it really should be burgundy. - Unless we go with a different dress. - Yes. No, no, no. Watch this. Wait, I may have something in the back. Oh, my God. Is everything all right, dear? Yeah. Yeah. Just Nana's stuff.
