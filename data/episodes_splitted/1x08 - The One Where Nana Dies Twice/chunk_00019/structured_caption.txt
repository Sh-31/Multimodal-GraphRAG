Episode: 1x08 - The One Where Nana Dies Twice
Chunk: chunk_00019
Subtitles: Your grandmother would've hated this. Well, sure. What with it being her funeral and all. No, I'd be hearing about... ...why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham? Or I didn't spend enough on flowers. If I spent more, she'd say: "Why waste your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead." That sounds like Nana. Do you know what it's like to grow up... ...with someone who is critical of every single thing you say? I can imagine. I tell you, it's a wonder your mother turned out... ...to be the positive, life-affirming person she is. That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again... ...I mean, if she was here right now... ...would you tell her?
