Subtitles: Tell her what? How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail. Like your hair, for example. I'm not sure I know what you're getting at. Would things have been better if you'd just told her the truth? No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along. Ha. More wine, dear? Oh, I think so. Those earrings look really lovely on you. Thank you. They're yours. Actually, they were Nana's. MEN: No!
