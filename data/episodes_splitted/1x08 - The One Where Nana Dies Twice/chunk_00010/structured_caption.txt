Subtitles: ROSS: Here's my retainer. I was just thinking... ...when my time comes... - Dad. Listen to me. When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea. You what? I wanna be buried at sea. It looks like fun. Define "fun." Come on. You'll make a day of it. You'll get a boat, pack a lunch... And then we throw your body in the water. Gee, that does sound fun. Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says, "Jack Geller, so predictable." Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say, "Buried at sea? Huh." That's probably what they'll say.
