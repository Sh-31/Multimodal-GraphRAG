Subtitles: [CLEARS THROAT] Flame Boy! Where exactly is your zoo? Well, it's technically not a zoo per se. It's, uh, more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about... Is it, uh, Marcel? - Yes. - Yes. Uh... Does he, uh, fight with other animals? No, no. He's very docile. Hmm. Even if he were cornered? Well, I don't know. Why? Um, how is he at handling small objects? He can hold a banana, if that's what you mean. What about a hammer or a small blade? [STAMMERS] Why would he need a blade? If he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns... ...you got to give the little guy something.
