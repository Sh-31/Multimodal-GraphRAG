Chunk: chunk_00010
Subtitles: Isn't there any way you can keep him? No. No. The vet said that unless he's in a place where he has regular access... ...to some monkey loving... ...he's just gonna get vicious. I just gotta get him into a zoo. - How do you get a monkey into a zoo? - I know that one! No, that's popes into a Volkswagen. We're applying to a lot of them. Our first choice would be a state zoo. You know, like, uh, San Diego. Right? But that may just be a pipe dream because he's out-of-state. My vet knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility. But that's two blocks from the beach. It's a total party zoo.
