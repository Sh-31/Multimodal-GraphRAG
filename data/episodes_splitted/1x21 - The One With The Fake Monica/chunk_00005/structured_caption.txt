Um, I'm taking classes with you, and I was wondering what they were. What are you doing? All right, great. Great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class. So you can dance with the woman that stole your card? She's got my life. I want to see who she is. Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! Honey, you're kind of losing it here.
