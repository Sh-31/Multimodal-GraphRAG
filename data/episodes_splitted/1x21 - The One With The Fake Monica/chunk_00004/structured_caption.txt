Chunk: chunk_00004
Subtitles: How about Joey Paponi? No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral. Joey Switzerland? Plus I think it should be Joe. Joey makes me sound like I'm... ...this big. Which I'm not! Joe, Joe, Joe... Stalin? Stalin. Do I know that name? That sounds familiar. - Well, it does not ring a bell with me. - Huh. Joe Stalin. You know, that's pretty good. - You might want to try Joseph. - Ah! Joseph Stalin! - I think you'd remember that! - Oh, yes!
