Chunk: chunk_00003
Subtitles: Ugh, Monica, you are not still going over that thing. - This woman's living my life. - What? She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me. Look at this. Look. She buys tickets to plays I want to see. She shops at stores that I'm intimidated by the salespeople. She spent $300 on art supplies. You're not an artist. Yeah, well, I might be if I had the supplies. I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't. Oh, Monica, come on. You do cool things. Oh, really? Let's compare, shall we? Oh, it's so late for "shall we?" Do I go horseback riding in the park, hmm? Do I take classes at The New School? - No. - No. This is so unfair. She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
