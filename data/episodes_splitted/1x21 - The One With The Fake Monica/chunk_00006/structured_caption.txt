You dance a dance class! Spare shoes are over there. What does she mean? I think she means, "You dance... ...a dance class!" Come on, come on, come on! RACHEL: Really? Hey, do you see anybody you think could be me? People, last time there were yogurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again! She could be you. Let's get started. Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight.
