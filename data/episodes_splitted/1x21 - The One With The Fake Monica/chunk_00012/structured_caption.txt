Chunk: chunk_00012
Subtitles: So when they caught on to the fact that we're short and have breasts... They threw us out. I was thrown out of a hotel! Me! Go, Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. Oh, by the way... ...tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show. Excuse me? There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing "Memories"... ...and make complete fools of ourselves. What do you say? No, no, no. Remember who you're dealing with here. Ha. I'm not like you. I can't even stand in front of a tap class. That's because of your Amish background. - What? - Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right? Right. Till I bought a blow dryer. Then I was shunned.
