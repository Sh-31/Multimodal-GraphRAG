Episode: 1x21 - The One With The Fake Monica
Chunk: chunk_00013
Subtitles: I was just like you. And then one day, I saw a movie that changed my life. - Did you ever see Dead Poets Society? - Uh-huh. I thought that movie was so incredibly... ...boring! I mean, that thing at the end where the kid... ...kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that? It's like, "Kid, wait a year. Leave home, do some community theater!" I walked out of there, and I thought: "Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back!" And that scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do. Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire. [LAUGHING] Oh, God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was our safety zoo.
