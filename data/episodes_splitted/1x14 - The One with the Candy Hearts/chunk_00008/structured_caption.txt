Subtitles: By the way, Chandler, I cut you out of all of my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads. That's okay. Are you sure? Because you could make little puppets out of them. And you could use them in your Theater of Cruelty. We can't do that. What? What can't you do? Uh, can I talk to you for a second? Over there? Uh, we might be leaving now. Tell me it's you and me "we." She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is. But I definitely want to be a part of it. Okay, you cannot do this to me. You're right. I'm sorry. You're right.
