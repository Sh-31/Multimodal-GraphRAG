Subtitles: Okay, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney. - Which one was he? - Pete the Weeper? Remember the guy that used to cry every time we had sex? [MIMICS SOBBING] "Oh, was it good for you?" Well, I'd take a little crying any day over Howard, the "I win" guy. "I win. I win." I went out with him for two months. I didn't get to win once. How do we end up with these jerks? We're good people. I don't know. I think we're like some kind of magnets. I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch. There's more beer, right? Oh. You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She says to break the bad-boyfriend cycle... ...you can do a cleansing ritual. Pheebs, this woman is voluntarily bald.
